The barbarian chieftain said: “What then are the greatest things that a man may find in life?” This is the sort of thing you’re supposed to say to maintain steppecred in barbarian circles.<br>

The man on his right thoughtfully drank his cocktail of mare’s milk and snowcat blood, and spoke thus: “The crisp horizon of the steppe, the wind in your hair, a fresh horse under you.”<br>

The man on his left said: “The cry of the white eagle in the heights, the fall of snow in the forest, a true arrow in your bow.”<br>

The chieftain nodded, and said: “Surely it is the sight of your enemy slain, the humiliation of his tribe and the lamentation of his women.”<br>

There was a general murmur of whiskery approval at this outrageous display.<br>

Then the chieftain turned respectfully to his guest, a small figure carefully warming his chilblains by the fire, and said: “But our guest, whose name is legend, must tell us truly: What is it that a man may call the greatest things in life?”<br>

The guest paused in the middle of another unsuccessful attempt to light up.<br>

“What shay?” he said, toothlessly.<br>

“I said: What is it that a man may call the greatest things in life?”<br>

The warriors leaned closer. This should be worth hearing.<br>

The guest thought long and hard and then said, with deliberation: “Hot water, good dentishtry and shoft lavatory paper.”<br>
