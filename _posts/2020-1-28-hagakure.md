Shida Kichinosuke said: “If it won’t damage your reputation whether you live or die, then you should live.” This is an oxymoron. He also said: “When you wonder if you should go or not, don’t go.” And: “When you wonder if you should eat or not, it is better not to eat. When you wonder if you should die or not, it is better to die.”<br><br>

In the Kamigata region, people carry multi-layered picnic boxes with them for enjoying the cherry blossoms. They are only used for one day, and having served their purpose, people just stamp on the boxes and discard them as they leave. It is indeed a capital conception. The end is important for all things.<br><br>

While walking together along the path, Master Jōchō proclaimed, “Are men not like masterfully controlled puppets? It is magnificent craftsmanship that allows us to walk, jump, prance, and speak even though there are no strings attached. We may be guests at next year’s Bon festival. We forget it is an ephemeral world in which we live.”<br><br>

It is discerning to behold the world as if it were a dream. You want to quickly wake up if you have a nightmare, and are relieved that it was only a dream. This world in which we exist now is no different.<br><br>

Two warriors met on a one-lane bridge but refused to give way, threatening to cut each other down if the other did not move. A radish seller came between the two men, and catching each one on either end of his shoulder-carrying pole, picked them up and spun them around to the opposite ends of the bridge. There are many ways of solving problems, and this counts as constructive service to one’s lord. It is most unfortunate to see precious retainers die needlessly, or create needless discord.<br><br>

The original intention of love is to take it with you to the grave. There is a poem that goes, "Observe when I am dead, my internal burning love for you, from the smoke ascending from my body." When I suggested that this was analogous to the highest form of love, they all concurred, and thereupon we called ourselves the 'smoke blokes'.

ناخودآگاه به یاد این شعر حافظ افتادم:<br><br>

With the passing of Lord Kōkokuin, his aide Ezoe Kinbei took his ashes to Mount Kōya to be consecrated. Kinbei then shut himself away in a hermitage and carved a figurine of his master from wood, and another of him prostrating before him. Kinbei returned home, probably on the first anniversary of his death, and committed oibara. The statue he carved was brought from Mount Kōya and enshrined at the Kōdenji Temple in Saga.<br><br>

Written in the Gunpō-kikisho, “Win first, then attack” is the essence of certain victory. Resourcefulness in peacetime means preparing for war. You must be able to defeat an enemy of 100,000 men with a force of 500.<br><br>

Warriors in olden times used to grow mustaches because their ears and noses would be removed and taken by the enemy as proof of their triumph in battle. The mustache was cut off together with the nose to confirm that the trophy head was that of a man and not a woman. If the head was found to be clean-shaven, it was just left to rot in the mud. A samurai cultivated his drooping mustache to ensure that his head, once removed, was not unceremoniously discarded. Master Jōchō said, “A man’s complexion will not change after being killed in battle, so long as he washes his face every morning.”

جنگجویان قدیم سبیل می‌گذاشتند، چرا که در گذشته به علامت آن‌که یک مرد در جنگ کشته شده ‌است، گوش و دماغش را می‌بریدند و به اردوی خود می‌بردند، و برای آن‌که آن شخص با یک زن اشتباه گرفته نشود،‌سبیلش را نیز به همراه بینی‌اش می‌بریدند. در این هنگام اگر بر صورت وی سبیل نبود، سر جنگجو را به دور می‌انداختند تا با سر یک زن اشتباه نشود. از این‌رو، سبیل گذاشتن یکی از طریقت سامورایی‌ها بود تا بدین‌سان هیچگاه سرشان پس از مرگ به‌دور افکنده نشود.<br>

چونه‌تومو گفته است، اگر انسان صورت خود را هر روز با آب بشوید، پس از کشته‌شدن، صورتش رنگ و رخسار خود را از دست نخواهد داد.

A certain man said, “There is a poem from the shrine [of Sugawara no Michizane] that goes: ‘If one follows the path of sincerity in his heart, although he may not pray, will the deities not watch over him?’ What can ‘path of sincerity’ possibly mean?” Another man answered. “As you appear to be partial to poetry, allow me to respond in verse. ‘Inasmuch as all things in this world are deceptive, sincerity is revealed only in death.’ Living as if already dead is how to embody the path of sincerity.”<br><br>

When the priest Ungo Oshō from Matsushima was traversing through the mountains one evening, he was ambushed by a bandit. Ungo exclaimed: “I am from this region. I am no itinerant priest. I have no money. I will give you the clothes I wear, but entreat you not to take my life.” The bandit reacted, “This is a wasted effort. I have no need for clothes,” and moved on. After walking a distance of around 1-chō, Ungo turned and hailed him back. “I have broken my vows by telling an untruth. As I was so flustered, I forgot about this piece of silver in my purse, even though I claimed to have no money. Do not be angry with me. Here it is, please accept it.” The bandit was awestruck by his admission. He shaved off his hair on the spot, and became a disciple.<br><br>

The following are teachings of Yamamoto Jin’uemon.<br><br>

1. Young men should not engage in poetry, reading graphic novels, gō, shōgi, or other such activities that will cause listlessness. Members of the Nakano clan should carry an oaken sword and hone their military preparedness for service.<br>

2. Anything is achievable through single-minded endeavor (bannō-isshin).<br>

3. Dog skin inside, tiger hide outside.<br>

4. The end phrase of a letter will not wear your brush out. You won’t break your back by bowing politely. (You can never be too polite.)<br>

5. Be sure to secure even a broiled chicken. (You should not let your guard down under any circumstance.)<br>

6. Whip even a galloping horse. (Don’t take things for granted, especially if they seem to be going well.)<br>

7. A man who asks questions candidly to your face holds no malice.<br>

8. A man lives for one generation, but a name forever.<br>

9. Money is there for the asking, but [good] men are not.<br>

10. A man who feigns laughter is a coward. A woman who does so is prurient.<br>

11. A real man will be able to tell tall tales seven times in 1-chō. (1-chō = 358 feet (110m).)<br>

12. It is not rude to ask even when you know the answer, but an imperative if you don’t.<br>

13. If you can see one direction, you can see eight. (As long as you are careful in your observance, you will be able to perceive all things.)<br>

14. If you know one truth, you will awaken to everything.<br>

15. Wrap your will in pine needles. (If you are sincere, the gifts you send as tribute are allowed to be small as it’s the thought that counts.)<br>

16. A trustworthy man is a kusemono (heroic warrior).<br>

17. Don’t insert your hands in the sides of your hakama. It is careless.<br>

18. Don’t open your mouth and yawn in front of others. Conceal it behind your sleeve or fan.<br>

19. A straw hat or kabuto should be worn with the front part low. (To conceal where one is looking.)<br>

20. When he was dying he said: “Everyone knows the name of Jin’uemon. It would be regrettable to groan because of the pain.” He never groaned until the very end.<br><br>

Matsudaira Izu-no-Kami said to Mizuno Kenmotsu [Tadayoshi]:450 “You are an expedient man, but it is a pity you are so short.” Kenmotsu retorted: “Indeed it is true. Some things turn out contrary to one’s liking. I would be a little taller if I was to chop your head off and attach it to my feet, but I am unable to have it my way.”<br><br>
