“Do you know why I enlisted in the Jihad?” The old eyes stared hard at Scytale. “I heard there was a thing called a sea. It is very hard to believe in a sea when you have lived only here among our dunes. We have no seas. Men of Dune had never known a sea. We had our windtraps. We collected water for the great change Liet-Kynes promised us . . . this great change Muad’dib is bringing with a wave of his hand. I could imagine a qanat, water flowing across the land in a canal. From this, my mind could picture a river. But a sea?”
Farok gazed at the translucent cover of his courtyard as though trying to probe into the universe beyond. “A sea,” he said, voice low. “It was too much for my mind to picture. Yet, men I knew said they had seen this marvel. I thought they lied, but I had to know for myself. It was for this reason that I enlisted.”
The youth struck a loud final chord on the baliset, took up a new song with an oddly undulating rhythm.
“Did you find your sea?” Scytale asked.


Farok remained silent and Scytale thought the old man had not heard. The baliset music rose around them and fell like a tidal movement. Farok breathed to its rhythm.


“There was a sunset,” Farok said presently. “One of the elder artists might have painted such a sunset. It had red in it the color of the glass in my bottle. There was gold . . . blue. It was on the world they call En feil, the one where I led my legion to victory. We came out of a mountain pass where the air was sick with water. I could scarcely breathe it. And there below me was the thing my friends had told me about: water as far as I could see and farther. We marched down to it. I waded out into it and drank. It was bitter and made me ill. But the wonder of it has never left me.”


Scytale found himself sharing the old Fremen’s awe.


“I immersed myself in that sea,” Farok said, looking down at the water creatures worked into the tiles of his floor. “One man sank beneath that water . . . another man arose from it. I felt that I could remember a past which had never been. I stared around me with eyes which could accept anything . . . anything at all. I saw a body in the water—one of the defenders we had slain. There was a log nearby supported on that water, a piece of a great tree. I can close my eyes now and see that log. It was black on one end from a fire. And there was a piece of cloth in that water—no more than a yellow rag . . . torn, dirty. I looked at all these things and I understood why they had come to this place. It was for me to see them.”


Farok turned slowly, stared into Scytale’s eyes. “The universe is unfinished, you know,” he said.
This one is garrulous, but deep, Scytale thought. And he said: “I can see it made a profound impression on you.”


“You are a Tleilaxu,” Farok said. “You have seen many seas. I have seen only this one, yet I know a thing about seas which you do not.”


Scytale found himself in the grip of an odd feeling of disquiet.
“The Mother of Chaos was born in a sea,” Farok said. “A Qizara Tafwid stood nearby when I came dripping from that water. He had not entered the sea. He stood on the sand . . . it was wet sand . . . with some of my men who shared his fear. He watched me with eyes that knew I had learned something which was denied to him. I had become a sea creature and I frightened him. The sea healed me of the Jihad and I think he saw this.”

پیرمرد نگاه چشمان سالخورده‌اش را به اسکیتاله دوخت و گفت: «می‌دانی چرا به لشکریان جهاد پیوستم؟ شنیده بودم چیزی به نام دریا وجود دارد. وقتی تمام عمرت را در این سیاره و بین تلماسه‌ها زندگی کرده باشی، سخت باور می‌کنی که چنین چیزی واقعی باشد. ما در این سیاره دریا نداریم. مردمان تلماسه در عمرشان دریار ندیده یودند. ما برای خودمان بادگیر داشتیم و با آن‌ها ابی را جمع می‌کردیم که برای آن دگرگونی بزرگ موعودِ لیت-کاینز لازم بود... همین دگرگونی بزرگی که حالا مودب با اشاره انگشتی به راهش می‌اندازد. تجسم قنات برایم راحت بود، یا تجسم اینکه آب در آبراهی بر روی زمین جاری شود. با کمک این تصویر می‌توانستم رودخانه را هم تصور کنم. ولی دریا...؟»

he flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not . . . yet, I occurred.
